# Volunteer-App
This app is a part of my Final year project, "Sabeel". It involves the login, signup of a volunteer. He can then see a list of available tasks from his dashboard. He can accept or reject a task. He can directly access the enrolled tasks. Moreover, he can register and verify a beneficiary for a donation task . It is a bilingual app
